        <div class="job-description"><p>I developed a web app that scraped Portland State University's course database and presented it in a beautiful, easy-to-use search engine. The main feature of the app was the ability to filter down your results based on subject, days of the week, and time ranges. The eventual goal was to allow students to sign in via their PSU account and be able to directly register for classes using the tool. The backend was written entirely using asynchronous IO with the Twisted library. It was originally written using MongoDB on the backend and Knockout.js on the frontend, but I later rewrote it to use PostgreSQL and AngularJS.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, leaving school has made it difficult to continue working on the project, so it remains unfinished.</p></div>
