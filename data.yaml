      I lead a team to develop apps and services on a range of tech stacks for our clients. I spent most of my time doing full-stack development for iOS apps in Swift, with PHP and Python on the backend, but I also did front-end web development with React and Redux. My role in the company went from being a one-man team working on an iOS app to eventually leading and mentoring a team of 3 junior developers. Among the projects I worked on are: two iOS apps, one of which is currently in the App Store ([BUCKiTDREAM](https://www.buckitdream.com/)); an interactive data visualization tool for [The Freshwater Trust](https://www.thefreshwatertrust.org/); a web-based calendar builder powered by React and Node.js; and a Magento-based e-commerce site ([Superfeet](https://www.superfeet.com/)).

    job_description: |
      I built a software platform for non-profit organizations that predicted the likelihood and capacity of donations from their prospects. The most important part of the software was the prediction algorithm, which combined machine learning with donor heuristics to produce a set of actionable reports for clients. At LaunchSide, I was in charge of development from day one, and built almost all of the software myself. After LaunchSide, I took on the work as an independent contractor; then later became an employee of the company; and eventually became a business partner. DonorDynamics was acquired and dissolved.
