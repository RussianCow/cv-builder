    job_description: |
      I lead a team of frontend engineers building a web and mobile platform for remote health studies. I served as an engineering manager for a year. My duties and accomplishments include:

      * Spearheading an initiative to improve reliability for a legacy product by migrating to TypeScript, adding robust monitoring, and removing redundant sources of truth
      * Building a new study platform from the ground up, including a novel server-driven approach to UI and a flexible content rendering engine that allows changes in logic to be made on the backend without any frontend code updates
      * Mentoring and leading a team of frontend engineers while coordinating larger efforts across teams
      * Identifying and addressing bottlenecks in our development process, such as increasing visibility into business needs via a streamlined, asynchronous approach to feature refinement
