    job_description: |
      Together with [Ben Goertz](https://bengoertz.com/), I founded a software consultancy called [Semi-Decent](https://www.semidecent.com/) where you pay for results, not hours. We are a software consultancy that ships software quickly. To accomplish this, we do a couple things differently:

      * We work in up to **6 week blocks** and **guarantee a deliverable** at the end of each block. If you need us for a larger project, you can book multiple blocks, but we plan each block as if it were a completely separate project with its own deliverable.

      * We offer a **100% money back guarantee**. If you aren't satisfied with our work at the end of a block, you can get all of your money back for that block and you never have to see us again.

      * We have **none of the overhead** of a traditional engineering organization. Once we've finalized requirements for a project, we put our heads down and get to work. This means we iterate more quickly and get vastly more work done than the average dev team.

      * Mentored and led a team of frontend engineers while coordinating larger efforts across teams
